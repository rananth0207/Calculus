# Calculus By Dummies
little intro to calculus repo
## What is this?
this is an introductory guide to Calculus, covering about what most universities/colleges would consider Calc A/B or 1/2. in high school terms, that would be AP Calculus AB and BC. there will be a full table of contents below, but the general scope is about the same as any class based off of Stewart's Early Transcendentals(which most calc classes are), but maybe incorporating a bit more intuition and proofing in the learning process. i also assume the reader has a solid understanding of algebra for the most part. if you don't, consider brushing up on that(maybe i'll try making a course)
i'm still in school, so if anyone notices any inaccuracies or points of confusion, feel free to submit a fix.
## Why did you make this?
honestly, my little brother asked me to teach him calculus and i figured it'd be fun to make and post my lessons. i'm also using this as a sort of exercise in LaTeX and Git, as well as a way to shore up a more pure understanding of calculus concepts. 

## Table of Contents

each concept will have two documents: one that takes a more intuitive approach, and one that lays out the more formal underpinnings of the concept. i'll add question guides as i go, and i hope in the future to add a few visualizations and such. the syllabus is as follows:

1. **essential concepts:** this includes slope, independent variables, rate of change, tangents and some background stuff about calculus itself.
2. **intro to limits:** this covers the concept of a limit, continuity, asymptotes, and evaluating limits.
3. **derivatives 1:** this will mostly cover the definition of a derivative, as well as some practical usages
i'll add more as i develop a lesson plan, but for now, it will be mostly on demand as i find time in my schedule.
